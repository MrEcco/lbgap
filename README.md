# Load Balancer Gap

Little multipurpose thing for using with load balancers. Return 200 OK (by default) for each request.

See here: https://hub.docker.com/r/mrecco/lbgap

## Configuration

**CUSTOM_CODE** - you can set other than 200 return code. By example 404, just for the fun! :)

**CUSTOM_RESPONCE** - you can set other than "OK" body return

## Tips

Give me 0.1 BTC if you want me to never write code.
Give me 1 BTC if you want me to believe in God.
Give me 10 BTC - I will become a monk.
